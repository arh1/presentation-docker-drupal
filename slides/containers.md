### Containers: Why

* Fast
* Easier to maintain than VMs
* Easy to share with other devs
* Easy to duplicate across locals, stage, prod


### Containers: What

```A container image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of a piece of software that includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, settings.```


### Containers: What

* Like a VM, but all containers on a host share the same OS
* Each container runs as its own process on the host
